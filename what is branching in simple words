Branching is a way to create a separate version of a project in software development. Think of it like making a copy of a recipe to try out new ingredients without changing the original.

When you branch, you can work on new features or fix problems without affecting the main project. Once you're happy with your changes, you can combine (or "merge") them back into the main version.
This helps keep everything organized and allows multiple people to work on different things at the same time.
